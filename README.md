# RedBlackTree

[RB-BST Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/red-black-tree-set-1-introduction-2/)

## Principles of Red Black Trees:

* Root is always **black**

* **Red** nodes cannot be adjacent

* Every path from root to null leaf has the same number of **black** nodes

## Day 1 Code:

* RBNode:
  public static final boolean RED = true;
  public static final boolean BLACK = False
  public size, boolean COLOR, left and right RBNodes, add RED/BLACK to toString

* public void rotateLeft

* public void rotateRight

* public boolean isRBT()

* public String toString()

* driver to test all three methods (Build a RBTree by hand and then check if it's legit)
